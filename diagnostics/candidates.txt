Search candidates for repeated GET causes

Patterns searched: app.use, app.get, res.redirect, next, setInterval, useEffect, fetch, axios, /favicon.ico, res.send, res.end, res.json

Matches:

1) server/notes/index.js (app.use express.json)
   line snippet: app.use(express.json());
   note: middleware order is important — no global request logger present. No redirects found, but top-level middleware may be a location to add diagnostics.

2) server/notes/index.js (error handler)
   line snippet: app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
   note: error handler exists; ensure it doesn't call next after sending response. It's correctly checking res.headersSent.

3) server/notes/index.js (several app.get handlers)
   lines: /api/notes, /api/notes/:id, /api/notes/:id/download, /healthz
   note: these are legitimate endpoints; repeated calls may originate from client polling (frontend) or missing favicon.

4) src/components/NotesUpload.tsx
   snippet: pollRef.current = window.setInterval(async () => {
   note: client-side polling exists and may produce repeated GET /api/notes/<id> calls — this is expected behavior for background job status polling.

5) src/pages/NotesMaker.tsx and src/components/NotesUpload.tsx
   snippet: fetch(`/api/notes/${jobId}`) and fetch('/api/notes')
   note: frontend polling of job status and job list; repeated identical GETs may be normal while waiting for job completion.

6) src/components/NotesWidget.tsx and src/pages/NotesCenter.tsx
   snippet: fetch('/api/notes')
   note: multiple UI components fetch the same endpoint; if mounted simultaneously they will cause duplicate requests.

7) src/hooks/useStudyTimer.ts and other components
   snippet: setInterval usage
   note: other setInterval usages unrelated to notes could still contribute if they call shared endpoints.

8) Multiple fetch spots in frontend (fetch, axios)
   note: look for duplicate mounting of components or multiple hooks that trigger fetches on mount.

9) No explicit /favicon.ico handler found in server code
   note: browsers often request /favicon.ico repeatedly when not handled; add a 204 handler to avoid repeated 404s.

Recommendations: instrument server with request logger, add favicon handler, inspect frontend polling logic for multiple components mounting simultaneously, consider debouncing or centralizing polling, and check for dev tooling (live-reload) that may probe endpoints.
